## 🧾 Database Setup

1. **Create a MySQL database** (e.g., `student_db`)
2. **Create table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_register (
    f_name VARCHAR(100),
    l_name VARCHAR(100),
    course VARCHAR(100),
    subject VARCHAR(100),
    year VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    birth DATE,
    contact VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
````

## 🔐 `credentials.py` (Required)

Create a `credentials.py` file in the same directory with your MySQL login info:

```python
host = "localhost"
user = "your_mysql_user"
password = "your_mysql_password"
database = "your_database_name"
```

---

## 🎨 `custom.py` (Optional Styling)

You can customize UI theme using a `custom.py` file:

```python
color_1 = "#f0f0f0"  # Left panel background
color_2 = "#007acc"  # Right panel and button bg
color_3 = "#000000"  # Text color
color_4 = "#ffffff"  # Entry field background

font_1 = "Helvetica"
font_2 = "Arial"
```
